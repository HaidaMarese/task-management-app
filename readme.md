### ðŸ§  Reflection

During this project, I practiced DOM manipulation, event handling, and using browser local storage. A challenge I faced was dynamically updating the task list while keeping filters and status updates in sync. I solved this by breaking my code into smaller functions and testing each one.

If I had more time, I would improve the UI with color-coding for different statuses, and add edit/delete functionality to tasks. I would also explore modularizing the JS using ES6 modules for better scalability.
